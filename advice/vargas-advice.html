				<h4>Practice proper time management</h4>
				<p>Listen, I'm the wrong guy to be seeking advice from.  I'm just starting this coding stuff.  One thing I can say is that I am having an absolute blast.  I finally found something that I like, I might eventually be really good at and that pays reasonably well.  I'm getting off topic.  Ah yes, time management!</p>

				<p>I'm just filling this in so that I can move on to more learning.  I'll get the real practice when i start my final project.  Here I go!</p>
